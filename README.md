This is just a little something to play around with sockets in cpp. since we aren't doing much cpp in uni atm i figured i'd do some noww.

we'll see if i'll build something bigger but at the moment i'm just having fun :)

you can hook this up with tailscale. have a little piece of hardware running the server, then people who have your software can connect to the server and chat with each other over encrypted terminal based chatting


todo:

need a way to keep track of users. make a sql db of users and passwords ----> the data will contain a username and a password. that is it.

the separate auth program will serve to generate the hash and send it to the db. which i will join together into one binary at the end.


so in order to communicate on the port 8080 of the server, the user must log in first.

communications before/during login processes will be done in an encrypted tunnel over port 8888 a key exchange must happen over a different socket than the server's socket for chats. 



dependencies:

sqlite33 libsqlite3-dev libsodium-dev

must therefore build with respective linking

g++ auth.cpp -l sqlite3 -lsodium
